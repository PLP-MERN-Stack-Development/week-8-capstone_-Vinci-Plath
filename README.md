### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/affirm-sos.git
cd affirm-sos
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in both `frontend/` and `backend/` directories with the following variables:

**Backend (.env)**
```env
PORT=5001
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Frontend (.env)**
